# GoFusion-RAG

GoFusion-RAG is a research-oriented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to improve the reliability, correctness, and maintainability of Go (Golang) code generated by large language models.

This project explores the integration of a 7B-scale base language model with a lightweight controller model that dynamically decides when and how retrieval should occur. The system is evaluated using automated compilation, unit testing, and structured ablation studies to quantify hallucination reduction and code quality improvements.

## Key Objectives
- Design a dynamic RAG architecture for Go code generation
- Reduce hallucinations through adaptive retrieval and verification
- Compare baseline LLM, static RAG, and controller-driven RAG approaches
- Conduct systematic pre-ablation and ablation studies
- Ensure reproducibility through clean experimentation pipelines

## Core Components
- **Base LLM**: 7B-scale language model for Go code generation
- **Retrieval Controller**: Lightweight LLM to determine retrieval necessity and scope
- **Knowledge Store**: Vector-based retrieval over Go documentation and code patterns
- **Evaluation Pipeline**: Automated compilation, testing, and hallucination scoring
- **Experiment Framework**: Baseline, static RAG, and ablation experiments

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.11
- PyTorch & Hugging Face Transformers
- LangChain (for RAG orchestration)
- FAISS (vector similarity search)
- GitHub & VS Code for development

## Project Status
🚧 In active development as part of an academic research project.
